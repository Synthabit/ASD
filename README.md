# ASD (Analytical Steam Database)

The Analytical Steam Library is a real-time data visualizer that utilizes Steam Web APIs to query and visualize data from Steam. Specifically, it would allow users to search for games uploaded to steam based on any combination of filters (among them price, sale duration, monthly number of players, and the like) chosen at the userâ€™s discretion. The resulting data would then be rendered as a sortable table and/or an illustrative graph.

_It should be noted that this project was decided as the final project for CS 4430: Database Management Systems at Western Michigan University (Spring 2020) by majority vote. As such, this project does not and will never have a commercial aim._
